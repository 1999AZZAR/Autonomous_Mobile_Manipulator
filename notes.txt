ros2 api need tobe accesible all the time:
- imu pos
- robot log
- 3 last command/execution data

recent updates (2025-11-11):
- Fixed IMU data display in web interface
  - Enhanced error handling in read_imu_data() method
  - Added safe dictionary access with .get() and default values
  - Added debug logging for troubleshooting

  - IMU sensor (MPU6050) verified working via direct test
  - Web interface now properly displays orientation, angular velocity, and acceleration data

- Made all scripts and documentation portable (no hardcoded paths)
  - Scripts use dynamic path resolution
  - Works on any machine/user/directory
  - Added README_SETUP.md explaining project root concept
  - Updated all documentation to use relative paths
  - Added path validation with helpful error messages
  - Created PORTABLE_PATHS_UPDATE.md documenting changes

- Added explicit hardware/simulation mode control
  - Web interface now accepts --hardware, --simulation, --auto flags
  - Created start_hardware.sh for real robot operation
  - Created start_simulation.sh for testing without hardware
  - Updated run.sh to set ROBOT_MODE environment variable
  - Added MODE_SELECTION.md comprehensive mode guide
  - Prevents web interface from getting stuck in simulation mode
  - Hardware mode requires I2C permissions and real sensors
  - Simulation mode works anywhere without hardware

- Added automatic workspace building
  - Created build_workspace.sh for first-time setup
  - Startup scripts now automatically build workspace if needed
  - Checks for ROS2, colcon, and Python dependencies
  - Installs missing Python packages automatically
  - Created FIRST_RUN.md complete setup guide from scratch
  - Scripts detect if workspace not built and offer to build it

- Implemented direct GPIO control (2025-11-11)
  - Fixed web UI not controlling servos/motors (was forwarding to non-existent port 5000)
  - Added GPIOController class for direct hardware control
  - Uses gpiozero + pigpio for precise PWM servo control
  - Controls 4x servos (gripper tilt/open/close/neck/base) via GPIO12,18,19,21
  - Controls 3x omni wheel motors via GPIO17/27, GPIO22/23, GPIO24/25
  - Controls 4x container servos via GPIO5,6,7,26
  - Fixed UI API endpoints: port 8000 for sensors/GPIO, port 5000 for navigation
  - Created install_gpio_dependencies.sh for easy setup
  - Created test_gpio.py to verify hardware connectivity
  - Created GPIO_CONTROL_SETUP.md comprehensive documentation
  - Created CHANGES_SUMMARY.md documenting all changes
  - Web interface now controls hardware directly without ROS2 control server
  - Automatic fallback to simulation mode if GPIO unavailable
  - All GPIO resources properly cleaned up on exit

- Consolidated scripts for cleaner project structure (2025-11-11)
  - Reduced 9 redundant scripts to 2 unified scripts
  - Created ./setup script (replaces setup_raspberry_pi.sh, build_workspace.sh)
    - Flags: --rpi (Raspberry Pi setup), --pc (PC/dev setup)
  - Created ./start script (replaces run.sh, start_robot.sh, start_hardware.sh, etc)
    - Modes: --hw (hardware), --sim (simulation), --test (testing)
    - Operations: --status, --logs, --stop, --restart, --shell, --clean
  - Moved old scripts to deprecated_scripts/ folder for reference
  - Updated README.md with new script usage
  - Created SCRIPT_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md documentation
  - Benefits: simpler commands, less confusion, easier maintenance
  - All features preserved, nothing lost in consolidation
